# Welcome to the Roller Package

PLEASE NOTE: I had some serious issues submitting (I ended up git initializing in nested folders...) As such I ended up having to create a new repository AND ALSO to add the workout03 tutorial inside the same folder... As such, the structure is as follows:
* Everything inside (except for workout03-related files) is the "roller" folder
* Workout03- related files are the tutorials

The vignette and tutorials provide a brief user-friendly overview of how to use this package. In short, you can use this package to roll any device of your construction, so long as it has more than two sides and associated probability values that obey the axioms of probability (between 0 and 1, and sum to 1).
