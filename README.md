# Welcome to the Roller Package

The vignette and tutorials provide a brief user-friendly overview of how to use this package. In short, you can use this package to roll any device of your construction, so long as it has more than two sides and associated probability values that obey the axioms of probability (between 0 and 1, and sum to 1).
